# Ascii-Art-Web 📝 📋

Ascii Art Web is the first 🚀 web application I have created in Go. Through this small project, I got acquainted with the basics of web development in Golang. 


## Description
Ascii-art-web consists in creating and running a server, in which it will be possible to use a web GUI (graphical user interface) version of a program that outputs text in a graphical representation of ASCII.

`Simply saying the application transforms input text into larger and attractive text.`
- Webpage allows the use of the different banners
- Allow the user to download the transformed text as a text file.

## Run Locally
- Clone the project
- Go to the project directory
- Start the server

```bash
  go run main.go
```
